            <p id="immigration">The Medical Services Plan of British Columbia (MSP) is the government-administered, single-payer health insurance scheme in the Canadian province of British Columbia, operating under the auspices of the country's national Medicare program. </p>
            <p id="immigration">Under the Canadian constitution, provinces are responsible for the delivery of health care, while the national Canada Health Act ensures access to universal health care for all citizens of the country. </p>
